[Week 7] Binary Trees
=====================


Summary
-------

Today we covered the basics of binary trees. 


Important terms
---------------

- **Graph**: a data structure made out of nodes and edges
    + you can think of the edges like roads
    + the edges could have a direct (like one way streets)
- **Node**: In a graph, this is like a variable, it represents a piece of information
    + you can also think of it as cities
- **Edge**: In a graph, edges connect two nodes
    + you can also think of edges as roads
- **Tree**:  a data structure with the following properties:
    + there are no cycles (you can't follow edges in a cirlce)
    + there is a root node (the top most part of the tree)
    + edges are called branches
    + each node can have children 
    + the node with children is the children's parent
- **Root node**: the topmost part of the tree
- **Binary Trees**: Each node can have at most 2 children
- **Leaves**: A leaf is the nodes in a tree with no children
- **Binary Search Trees**: each parent is larger than its left child and smaller than its right
