Potential extras:

1. Undo Turtle:
    - create a class which has functions that move a turtle by binding them to keyboard or mouse presses.
      for each time an action happens, save an undo-stack. then, let the user hit an undo button to reverse the changes. 

2. Simulation Queue:
    - write a simulator that uses a queue to schedule the events as they happen 
3. Load data and store in queue or stack
