[Exercise] Card Deck 1.0
========================

We are going to write a basic class that simulates a deck of cards. 
We are going to use this class for several of our lessons. 


First Steps
-----------

The first step is to get the skeleton of the class written

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    
    class CardDeck:
        def __init__(self):
            self.all_cards = list()
        
1. Why create a list?  Why not a :code:`set`, :code:`tuple`, or :code:`dict`?
